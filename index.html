          <i>Immigrant Detention Centers</i> are where immigrants are kept if
          they are suspected of visa violations, unauthorized entry, and
          individuals waiting on a decision made regarding their deportation.

          <u>What is Happening and Why Are We Concerned</u>
        </h1>
        <p class="inform">
          Reported by Madeline Joune from <i>The Times</i>, adults and children have
          been cramped in cages, where they may be held for days, weeks, and
          even month long periods. In the cages they aren't given bare
          necessities like soap, toothpaste, or access to water. The Department of
          Homeland Security’s inspectors found 900 people in a space that can
          only hold 125. Babies drink from unsanitized bottles with almost no
          diapers. Lights are kept on for 24 hours a day and temperatures remain
          extremely cold. Along with these inhuman conditions, the flu, lice,
          chicken pox and scabies have been an ongoing problem. Because the sick
          aren't separated from those with good healthy and medical care is hard to comeby, these diseases pose even more of a threat. Due to new rules,
          people can only be kept for a maximum of 72 hours, however this is often surpassed. To make up for it lack of space, tent cities were created
          and unused buildings (not meant for people to be living in) were
          converted into storage spaces for immigrants. <br />

        In 2018 <u>Mariee Juárez</u>, a 2 year old in the detention camp, died
        of what her mother, <u>Yazmin Juárez </u>considered to be a perventable
        death. Initially, the mother-daughter duo fled from Guadelope, in hopes
        for a better looking future. They were kept in a cage with 30 other
        people. Mariee was told to be in good health when first checked by the
        doctors. They were then admitted to Family Residential Center in
        Dilley where Yazmin noted,
        <i
          >"no effort was being made to separate the sick from the healthy or to
          care for them."</i
        >
        After a week of their stay, Mariee developed a cough. As a concerned
        mother Yazmin brought Mariee to a clinic, where they perscribed honey
        and Tylenol for her <b>resporitory infection</b>. Mariee worstened, and
        ten days later her mother said she'd lost 8% of her body fat. After
        returning to the clinic and Mariee being rediagnosed with an ear
        infection, Yazmin begging the doctors to do further exams, but the
        medical staff declined. Mariee ended up on the ventilator for 6 weeks
        because of a resporatory infection, when she later died on
        <b>Mother's Day</b>.

      <p class="inform">
        In July, the University of San Francisco School of Education went to
        work with families released from ICE detention centers. The kids working
        spoke of being kept in cages they called "La Perrera" which was a common
        phrase used in Latin America to where overly aggressive dogs could be
        kept. They were separated from families, and treated in horrible
        conditions. Now, these kids suffer from severe emotional trauma such as
        anxiety, stress and fears of separation from their parents. Click the
        following to join the 81,000+ who have already signed to try to stop
        immigrant children from isolation from their parents, and to tell
        Immigration Customs Enforcement to housing children in these cages.

        Similar to the petition above, American Friends Service Community is
        trying to close down the children's detention center, housing over 3,000
        children trying to seek asylum in the United States. Like many other
        detention facilities, the conditions are unlivable and therefore
        dangerous for young kids to stay in.
