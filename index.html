          <u>What is a Immigrant Detention Center?</u>
        </h1>
        <p class="inform">
          <i>Immigrant Detention Centers</i> are where Immigrants are kept if
          they are suspected of visa violations, unauthorized entry, and
          individuals waiting on a decision made regarding their deportation.

      <h1 class="titles"><u>What is Happening and Why Are We Concerned</u></h1>
      <p class="inform">
        Reported by Madeline Joune from the times, adults and children
        have been cramped in cages, where they may be held for days, weeks, and
        even month long periods. In the cages they aren't even bare necessities
        like soap, toothpaste, or access to water. Department of Homeland
        Securityâ€™s inspector found 900 people in a space that can only hold 125.
        Babies drink from unsanitized bottles with almost no diapers. Lights are
        kept on for 24 hours a day and temperatures remain extremely cold. Along
        with these inhuman conditions, the flu, lice, chicken pox and scabies
        have been an ongoing problem. Because the sick aren't separated from
        those with good healthy and medical care isn't amazing, these diseases
        pose even more of a threat. Due to new rules, people can only be kept
        for a maximum of 72 hours, however this time period is often surpassed.
        To make up for it tent cities were created, and unused buildings (not
        meant for people to be living in) were converted into storage spaces for
        immigrants. <br />

      <p class="inform">
        It's unrealistic to assume you will go to these centers yourself to
        demand justice, even so it wouldn't hurt to help.
